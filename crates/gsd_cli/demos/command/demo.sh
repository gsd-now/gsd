# Demo: Command actions (no agent pool needed)
#
# This demo shows how to use command actions to transform data locally
# using jq, without needing an agent pool or LLM.
#
# The workflow:
#   Split -> Process (x3) -> Collect (x3)
#
# Split takes an array of items and fans out to Process
# Process doubles each number
# Collect terminates
