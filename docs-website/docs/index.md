# Introduction

GSD (Get Sh*** Done) is a set of tools for defining task queues as type-safe state machines whose tasks are executed by long-lived agents.

## Why GSD?

LLMs are incredibly powerful tools. They are being asked to perform increasingly complicated, long-lived tasks. Unfortunately, the naive way to work with agents quickly hits limits. When their context becomes too full, they become forgetful and make the wrong decisions.

GSD provides structure and protects context, enabling LLMs to perform dramatically more complicated and ambitious tasks.

### Key Features

- **Type-Safe State Machines**: Define task queues with validated state transitions
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Agents only see the instructions they need for their current task
- **Long-Lived Agents**: Workers persist across tasks, avoiding startup costs
- **JSON Configuration**: Define workflows via simple JSON config files

### Why isn't /loop sufficient?

Tools like Claude's `/loop` command are great for simple, iterative tasks. But for complex refactors and multi-step workflows, they fall short:

- **Predictability**: With GSD, you know exactly what states your workflow can be in and what transitions are valid. You can reason about the decision tree before running it.
- **Guaranteed Structure**: The state machine enforces that agents follow the defined workflow. Invalid transitions are rejected and retried.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each step has its own instructions, schema, and retry policy. Agents don't need to remember the entire workflow—they just handle their current task.
- **Parallelism**: GSD naturally supports fan-out patterns where multiple tasks run concurrently, then aggregate results.
- **Auditability**: Every state transition is explicit and logged. You can trace exactly how the workflow progressed.

For simple "keep trying until it works" loops, `/loop` is fine. For complex, multi-agent workflows where you need guarantees about behavior, GSD provides the structure that makes ambitious automation possible.

## Components

### GSD CLI

The main command-line tool for running task queues:

```bash
gsd run --config config.jsonc --pool agents --entrypoint-value '{}'
```

### Agent Pool

A daemon that manages a pool of long-running agents:

```bash
agent_pool start --pool agents
```

### Task Queue Library

A Rust library for defining task queues as type-safe state machines with compile-time guarantees.
