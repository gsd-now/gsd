# GSD Recipes

This directory contains example configurations for common task queue patterns.

## Quick Reference

| Recipe | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [Linear Pipeline](linear-pipeline.md) | Step-by-step processing (A → B → C) |
| [Branching](branching.md) | Conditional paths based on output |
| [Fan-Out](fan-out.md) | Split one task into many parallel tasks |
| [Fan-Out with Finally](fan-out-finally.md) | Parallel changes with commit on completion |
| [Sequential Processing](sequential.md) | Enforce single-threaded task execution |
| [Adversarial Review](adversarial-review.md) | Implement → judge → revise loop |
| [Branching Refactor](branching-refactor.md) | Route to specialized agents based on analysis |
| [Error Recovery](error-recovery.md) | Catch failures and route to recovery steps |
| [Pre/Post/Finally Hooks](hooks.md) | Transform data, aggregate results, cleanup |
| [Validation](validation.md) | Schema validation for inputs and outputs |
| [Local Commands](commands.md) | Run shell scripts instead of agents |

## Config Structure

Every GSD config has this structure:

```jsonc
{
  "entrypoint": "StepName",
  "options": {
    "timeout": 60,
    "max_retries": 3,
    "max_concurrency": 5
  },
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "StepName",
      "value_schema": { "type": "object" },
      "pre": "./optional-pre-hook.sh",
      "action": { "kind": "Pool", "instructions": { "inline": "Do something. Return `[]`." } },
      "post": "./optional-post-hook.sh",
      "finally": "./optional-finally-hook.sh",
      "next": ["NextStep1", "NextStep2"]
    },
    {
      "name": "NextStep1",
      "value_schema": { "type": "object" },
      "action": { "kind": "Pool", "instructions": { "inline": "Continue. Return `[]`." } },
      "next": []
    },
    {
      "name": "NextStep2",
      "value_schema": { "type": "object" },
      "action": { "kind": "Pool", "instructions": { "inline": "Alternative path. Return `[]`." } },
      "next": []
    }
  ]
}
```

## Terminology

- **Step**: A named stage in your workflow (e.g., "Analyze", "Implement", "Review")
- **Task**: An instance of a step with a specific value (e.g., `{step: "Analyze", value: {file: "main.rs"}}`)
- **Action**: What happens when a task runs (Pool = send to agent, Command = run locally)
- **Transition**: Moving from one step to another via the `next` field
- **Hook**: A shell command that runs before (pre), after (post), or when descendants complete (finally)
