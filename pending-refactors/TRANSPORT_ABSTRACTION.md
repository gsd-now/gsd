# Transport Abstraction Plan

## Dependencies

**Must complete after**: DAEMON_REFACTOR.md
- The traits defined here use `async fn`
- Requires tokio runtime to be established first

## Problem

The socket vs file distinction creates duplicate internal code paths:

```rust
// Client side - two separate functions with duplicate logic
pub fn submit(root: &Path, input: &str) -> io::Result<Response>;      // socket
pub fn submit_file(root: &Path, input: &str) -> io::Result<Response>; // file

// Daemon - two code paths for receiving submissions
// - Socket: accept(), read from stream
// - File: watch pending/, read task.json

// Agent communication - only file-based
// - Daemon writes agents/<name>/task.json
// - Agent polls for task.json, writes response.json
```

**Issues:**
1. Two internal code paths to maintain
2. Daemon has separate handling for socket vs file submissions
3. Agents can't use sockets even when not sandboxed

## Goals

1. **Internal simplicity:** Unify code paths behind a trait. Both transports go through the same internal logic.

2. **Identical caller API:** Both transports have the same interface - call a method, get a response back. The only difference is setup:

```rust
// Socket-based
let client = SocketClient::connect(&pool)?;
let response = client.submit(&task).await?;  // Response returned directly

// File-based
let client = FileClient::new(&pool)?;
let response = client.submit(&task).await?;  // Response returned directly (polling is internal)
```

The file-based implementation handles writing task.json and polling for response.json internally. Callers don't deal with files - they just call `submit()` and get a `Response` back.

```rust
// Client submits task - transport chosen at construction
let client = PoolClient::socket(pool_path)?;  // or PoolClient::file(pool_path)?
let response = client.submit(task_json).await?;

// Agent receives tasks - transport chosen at construction
let agent = AgentConnection::socket(pool_path, name)?;  // or AgentConnection::file(...)
loop {
    let task = agent.recv().await?;
    let response = process(task);
    agent.send(response).await?;
}
```

## Communication Patterns

There are two communication channels:

### 1. Client → Daemon (task submission)

```
Client                    Daemon
   |                         |
   |---- submit task ------->|
   |                         |
   |<--- response -----------|
   |                         |
```

**Socket transport:**
- Client connects to `daemon.sock`
- Client writes task, reads response
- Connection closed after each request

**File transport:**
- Client writes `pending/<uuid>/task.json`
- Client polls for `pending/<uuid>/response.json`
- Client cleans up directory

### 2. Daemon → Agent (task dispatch)

```
Daemon                    Agent
   |                         |
   |---- dispatch task ----->|
   |                         |
   |<--- response -----------|
   |                         |
```

**Current (file-only):**
- Daemon writes `agents/<name>/task.json`
- Agent polls for task.json
- Agent writes `response.json`
- Daemon watches for response.json

**Potential socket transport:**
- Agent connects to daemon, keeps connection open
- Daemon writes task to agent's connection
- Agent writes response back
- Connection stays open for next task

## Proposed Traits

### For Clients (submitting tasks)

```rust
/// A connection to the pool for submitting tasks.
///
/// Both implementations have identical usage:
///   let response = client.submit(&task).await?;
///
/// The transport details (socket connection vs file I/O) are handled internally.
#[async_trait]
pub trait PoolClient: Send + Sync {
    /// Submit a task and wait for the response.
    /// Returns the Response directly - caller never deals with files or sockets.
    async fn submit(&self, task: &str) -> io::Result<Response>;
}

/// Socket-based client (fast, requires socket access)
pub struct SocketClient {
    socket_path: PathBuf,
}

/// File-based client (works in sandboxes)
/// Internally: writes task.json, polls for response.json, cleans up
pub struct FileClient {
    pending_dir: PathBuf,
}

impl PoolClient for SocketClient { ... }
impl PoolClient for FileClient { ... }
```

### For Agents (receiving tasks)

```rust
/// A connection to the pool for receiving and completing tasks.
///
/// Both implementations have identical usage:
///   let task = agent.recv().await?;
///   // ... do work ...
///   agent.send(&response).await?;
///
/// The transport details are handled internally.
#[async_trait]
pub trait AgentConnection: Send {
    /// Wait for the next task. Blocks until a task is available.
    async fn recv(&mut self) -> io::Result<TaskPayload>;

    /// Send a response for the current task.
    async fn send(&mut self, response: &str) -> io::Result<()>;
}

/// File-based agent (current implementation)
/// Internally: polls for task.json, writes response.json
pub struct FileAgent {
    agent_dir: PathBuf,
}

/// Socket-based agent (keeps persistent connection to daemon)
/// Internally: reads task from stream, writes response to stream
pub struct SocketAgent {
    stream: UnixStream,
}

impl AgentConnection for FileAgent { ... }
impl AgentConnection for SocketAgent { ... }
```

## Socket-Based Agent Protocol

For agents to use sockets, we need a protocol for the persistent connection:

```
Agent                                Daemon
   |                                    |
   |---- REGISTER {name} -------------->|  Agent connects and registers
   |                                    |
   |<--- TASK {id, content} ------------|  Daemon sends task
   |                                    |
   |---- RESPONSE {id, content} ------->|  Agent sends response
   |                                    |
   |<--- TASK {id, content} ------------|  Next task...
   |                                    |
   |---- HEARTBEAT -------------------->|  (optional) Keep-alive
   |                                    |
   |---- DEREGISTER ------------------->|  Agent disconnects
   |                                    |
```

**Message format (JSON lines):**
```json
{"type": "register", "name": "agent-1"}
{"type": "task", "id": "abc123", "content": {...}}
{"type": "response", "id": "abc123", "content": "..."}
{"type": "heartbeat"}
{"type": "deregister"}
```

## Daemon Changes

The daemon uses a trait for agent communication, not an enum match:

```rust
/// Trait for daemon's communication with an agent.
/// The daemon calls these methods without knowing the transport.
#[async_trait]
trait AgentChannel: Send {
    /// Send a task to the agent.
    async fn dispatch(&mut self, task: &Task) -> io::Result<()>;

    /// Check if a response is available (non-blocking).
    async fn poll_response(&mut self) -> io::Result<Option<String>>;

    /// Send a heartbeat check (if applicable).
    async fn heartbeat(&mut self) -> io::Result<()>;
}

struct FileAgentChannel {
    agent_dir: PathBuf,
}

struct SocketAgentChannel {
    stream: UnixStream,
}

impl AgentChannel for FileAgentChannel {
    async fn dispatch(&mut self, task: &Task) -> io::Result<()> {
        fs::write(self.agent_dir.join("task.json"), &task.content)?;
        Ok(())
    }
    // ...
}

impl AgentChannel for SocketAgentChannel {
    async fn dispatch(&mut self, task: &Task) -> io::Result<()> {
        let msg = json!({"type": "task", "content": task.content});
        self.stream.write_all(msg.to_string().as_bytes()).await?;
        self.stream.write_all(b"\n").await?;
        Ok(())
    }
    // ...
}

/// Agent state holds a boxed trait object - no matching on transport type.
struct AgentState {
    channel: Box<dyn AgentChannel>,
    in_flight: Option<InFlightTask>,
}

impl AgentState {
    async fn dispatch(&mut self, task: Task) -> io::Result<()> {
        // No match - just call the trait method
        self.channel.dispatch(&task).await?;
        self.in_flight = Some(InFlightTask { /* ... */ });
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

The daemon code never matches on transport type. All transport-specific logic is encapsulated in the trait implementations.

## CLI Changes

The CLI explicitly chooses transport:

```rust
// submit_task command
let client: Box<dyn PoolClient> = if use_file {
    Box::new(FileClient::new(&pool_path)?)
} else {
    Box::new(SocketClient::connect(&pool_path)?)
};
let response = client.submit(&task_json).await?;

// get_task command (for agents)
let agent: Box<dyn AgentConnection> = if use_file {
    Box::new(FileAgent::new(&pool_path, &name)?)
} else {
    Box::new(SocketAgent::connect(&pool_path, &name)?)
};
loop {
    let task = agent.recv().await?;
    println!("{}", serde_json::to_string(&task)?);
    // ... agent does work ...
    agent.send(&response).await?;
}
```

The `--file` flag (or similar) determines which transport to use.

## Migration Path

### Phase 1: Extract traits (no behavior change)
1. Define `PoolClient` trait
2. Implement `SocketClient` (wraps current `submit()`)
3. Implement `FileClient` (wraps current `submit_file()`)
4. Update CLI to use trait with explicit transport choice

### Phase 2: Unify daemon submission handling
1. Both socket and file submissions produce the same internal `Task` struct
2. Single code path for enqueueing tasks
3. `ResponseTarget` enum already handles response routing

### Phase 3: Add socket-based agents (optional)
1. Define `AgentConnection` trait
2. Implement `FileAgent` (current behavior)
3. Implement `SocketAgent` (new)
4. Update daemon to accept agent socket connections
5. Update CLI `get_task` to use trait

## Open Questions

1. **Socket agent registration:** Should socket agents register on the same `daemon.sock`, or a separate `agents.sock`?

2. **Mixed mode:** Can the daemon handle some agents on sockets and others on files simultaneously? (Yes, with `AgentChannel` enum)

3. **Backward compatibility:** Keep `submit()` and `submit_file()` as convenience functions that use the traits internally?

4. **Async vs sync:** Should the traits be async? The file-based implementation has polling which benefits from async. Socket is naturally async.

## Future Enhancements (not in scope)

- **Auto-detection:** Factory function that tries socket, falls back to file
- **Remote pools:** TCP transport for pools on other machines

## Benefits

1. **Internal simplicity:** One code path in the daemon, not two
2. **Less duplication:** Shared logic for task handling regardless of transport
3. **Testability:** Can mock the trait for unit tests
4. **Flexibility:** Easy to add new transports later (e.g., TCP for remote pools)
5. **Performance:** Socket-based agents would be faster than file polling
