# To-Dos and Future Directions

## Agent --continue Flag

When an agent starts with a specific ID via `get_task --name <ID>`, we might want to distinguish between:

1. **Fresh start**: This is a brand new agent with this ID
2. **Resume**: This agent existed before and we want to continue where we left off

Potential approach:
- Add `--continue` flag to `get_task`
- Without `--continue`: If agent directory exists, error (or delete it first)
- With `--continue`: If agent directory exists, resume (check for pending task.json, etc.)

Use cases:
- Agent process restarts mid-task and wants to pick up where it left off
- Graceful recovery from crashes
- Session continuity for long-running agents

Open questions:
- What exactly constitutes "state" to continue? Just the directory existence, or pending task/response files?
- Should the daemon track agent state beyond the directory?
- How does this interact with keepalives? (Probably: if continuing, skip initial keepalive?)

This needs more thought before implementation.

## Iterator Yielded Items

Currently `TaskRunner` yields `&mut Ctx` after each task completion. Could also yield a value from `process`:

```rust
trait QueueItem<Ctx> {
    type Yield = ();  // Default to unit
    // ...
    fn process(...) -> ProcessResult<Self::NextTasks, Self::Yield>;
}

struct ProcessResult<Tasks, Yield> {
    tasks: Tasks,
    yield_value: Yield,
}
```

This would allow the iterator to yield meaningful data per task completion without requiring context inspection.

## Step Prioritization

Steps could have priority weights affecting dispatch order. Higher priority tasks get processed first when multiple are queued. Useful for:

- Critical path optimization
- Background vs foreground work
- Resource-intensive vs lightweight tasks

## Streaming Support

Currently `QueueItem::start` returns a `Command`. Should support streaming responses:

```rust
enum TaskExecution {
    Command(Command),
    Stream(BoxedStream<...>),
    Local(BoxFuture<...>),  // Handle locally without spawning
}
```

Or at minimum, make Command optional for local-only processing.

## Fan-in / Reduce Pattern

We have fan-out (tasks spawn more tasks) but no built-in reduce. Example test case:

```rust
// Two tasks processed in random order:
// 1. LookupFirstName { user_id }
// 2. LookupLastName { user_id }
//
// In process, store partial results in context.
// When we have both first + last name for a user,
// emit ProcessFullName { first, last } task.
```

Need unit tests exercising context-based coordination between tasks.

### JSON Config Approaches (Not Yet Decided)

**Option 1: Barrier/Join Step**
```json
{
  "name": "FullNameReady",
  "join": ["FetchFirstName", "FetchLastName"],
  "instructions": "Both names fetched. Results in $JOIN_RESULTS."
}
```

**Option 2: Accumulator in Value**
Tasks pass accumulator through `value` - state travels with tasks, no daemon tracking:
```json
// FetchFirstName returns:
[{"kind": "FetchLastName", "value": {"first": "John", "pending": ["last"]}}]
// FetchLastName sees pending empty, emits ProcessFullName
```

**Option 3: Entity-Scoped Context**
```json
{
  "name": "FetchFirstName",
  "context_key": "user:{{user_id}}",
  "on_context_complete": ["first", "last"],
  "then": "ProcessFullName"
}
```

Option 2 is most "JSON-native" but requires agents to understand the accumulator pattern. Need more real-world use cases before committing.

## Sequential Processing by Key

Sometimes you want multiple tasks for the same entity (e.g., file) to be processed sequentially rather than in parallel. Example: three refactors for `main.rs` should be applied one at a time with commits between each.

### Workaround: Self-Looping Step

This is achievable today by having the agent pass remaining items through the value:

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "Analyze",
      "instructions": "Analyze files. Return list of refactors grouped by file.",
      "next": ["ProcessRefactorList"]
    },
    {
      "name": "ProcessRefactorList",
      "instructions": "Apply first refactor from the list. Return remaining list (or empty to finish).",
      "next": ["ProcessRefactorList", "Commit", "Done"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Commit",
      "instructions": "Commit changes for the file. Could also re-analyze.",
      "next": ["ProcessRefactorList", "Done"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Done",
      "next": []
    }
  ]
}
```

The agent receives `{"refactors": [...], "current_file": "..."}` and:
1. Applies the first refactor for `current_file`
2. Returns the same task with one fewer refactor
3. When the file's refactors are exhausted, emits `Commit` or moves to next file

**Limitation**: Requires agents to understand the list-processing pattern. The daemon has no concept of "key" for sequential ordering.

### Potential Future Primitive

Could add `sequential_key` to steps:
```json
{
  "name": "ApplyRefactor",
  "sequential_key": "{{value.file}}",
  "instructions": "..."
}
```

Tasks with the same key value would be queued and processed one at a time. This would require daemon-side tracking of in-flight keys.

## Durability

Currently no durability guarantees. Tasks in flight are lost on crash. Document this clearly and consider:

- Optional persistence layer
- At-least-once vs at-most-once semantics
- Checkpoint/resume support

## Timeout Handling

Need timeout support for tasks. Considerations:

- Wrapper around `agent_pool submit` with timeout
- If submit process dies, agent_pool should detect and requeue
- Configurable per-task timeouts
- Distinguish between task timeout vs agent death

## Granular Retry Options

**Status: Implemented** in `crates/gsd_config/src/config.rs`.

Global options `retry_on_timeout` and `retry_on_invalid_response` (both default `true`) can be overridden per-step via `StepOptions`. Use `EffectiveOptions::resolve()` to merge.

## No-IPC Mode

For sandboxed environments where Unix sockets are blocked, implement file-based task submission:

- Submit writes to a `pending/` folder
- Daemon polls for new files
- Response written back to same folder
- Submit blocks until response appears

## GSD JSON Runner

**Status: Implemented** in `crates/gsd_config/` (library) and `crates/gsd_cli/` (binary).

The `gsd` binary accepts JSON configuration:

```bash
gsd run config.json --root /tmp/pool --initial '[{"kind": "Start", "value": {}}]'
gsd docs config.json
gsd validate config.json
```

See `crates/gsd_config/README.md` for full documentation.

## Binary vs Library Mode

There's a fundamental tension between two usage modes:

**Binary mode** (CLI): The daemon runs as a standalone process, inherently stateful, with a never-returning main loop. Process lifecycle is managed externally (systemd, supervisord, etc.).

**Library mode** (embedded): The daemon is spawned within another Rust program via `spawn()`, returning a `DaemonHandle` for programmatic control (pause, resume, shutdown).

Current design supports both:
- `run()` for binary mode (never returns on success, `Infallible` return type)
- `spawn()` for library mode (returns handle for control)

Future considerations:
- Should library mode support async (`spawn_async()` returning a future)?
- Should there be a way to inject custom event handlers (hooks for task lifecycle)?
- Could the binary mode delegate to library mode internally for code reuse?

## Agent Differentiation (Non-Goal)

**Explicitly NOT planned**: Agent prioritization, tagging, or differentiation.

Currently all agents are equal - tasks are dispatched to any available agent. We do not plan to add:
- Agent capabilities/tags (e.g., "this agent handles GPU tasks")
- Task routing based on agent properties
- Priority queues for different task types
- Agent affinity or stickiness

Why not:
- Adds significant complexity to the dispatch logic
- Most use cases don't need it (homogeneous worker pools)
- Can be implemented in userspace if needed (separate pools per capability)
- Goes against the "simple pool of identical workers" model

If differentiation is needed, consider running multiple `agent_pool` instances, one per agent type, and routing tasks appropriately at submission time.

## Step Cleanup/Post-Processing

Steps might want to run cleanup actions after completion, regardless of which next step is chosen. Use cases:

- Commit changes after each step
- Run linters/formatters after code modifications
- Log metrics or telemetry
- Release resources or locks

### Potential Approaches

**Option 1: `on_complete` field**
```json
{
  "name": "Implement",
  "on_complete": "./scripts/lint-and-format.sh",
  "next": ["Test", "Done"]
}
```

**Option 2: Lifecycle hooks**
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "after_step": "./scripts/cleanup.sh"
  },
  "steps": [...]
}
```

**Option 3: Leave to agents**
Agents can include cleanup in their response logic. Simpler but requires agent awareness.

Not yet decided - need more use cases to understand the right abstraction.

## Hung Agent Detection

Agents can hang (infinite loops, deadlocks, waiting on unavailable resources). The daemon should detect this and handle it gracefully:

- Per-task timeout configuration
- Daemon monitors in-flight task duration
- On timeout: respond to submitter with `NotProcessed { reason: Timeout }`
- Agent cleanup: kill hung agent process, mark agent as unhealthy
- Agent recovery: option to auto-restart agents or remove them from pool

This is distinct from task-level timeouts (handled by the submit wrapper). The daemon needs to know when an agent itself is stuck, not just when a particular task is taking too long.

## Agent Auto-Deregistration on Repeated Timeouts

Track timeouts per agent. After N timeouts (e.g., 3), auto-deregister the agent from the pool:

- Daemon tracks timeout count per agent
- On timeout, increment counter
- At threshold (configurable, default 3), remove agent directory
- `get_task` should return an error if the agent was deregistered, explaining why
- Agent can re-register to reset their timeout count and try again

This prevents slow/broken agents from clogging the pool indefinitely.

## Low-Level File Protocol Documentation

Currently the agent protocol documentation only covers the CLI commands (`get_task`, `deregister_agent`). The underlying file protocol (`task.json`, `response.json`) is an implementation detail.

If we need to support agents that can't use the CLI (e.g., non-Rust agents, embedded systems), we should document the raw file protocol:

- Agent creates directory in `agents/`
- Daemon writes `task.json` when task is assigned
- Agent writes `response.json` when done
- Daemon cleans up both files

For now, the CLI abstracts this away. Expose only if there's a concrete use case.

## Default Entry Step

Currently, `gsd run` requires `--initial` to specify starting tasks. For simple workflows with a single entry point, this is verbose:

```bash
gsd run config.json --pool /tmp/pool --initial '[{"kind": "Start", "value": {}}]'
```

Could support a `default_step` in config that makes `--initial` optional:

```json
{
  "default_step": "Start",
  "steps": [
    {"name": "Start", "next": ["Analyze"]},
    ...
  ]
}
```

Then `gsd run config.json --pool /tmp/pool` would automatically start with `[{"kind": "Start", "value": {}}]`.

Rules:
- If `default_step` is set and `--initial` is provided, use `--initial` (explicit wins)
- If `default_step` is set and no `--initial`, use the default step with empty value `{}`
- If no `default_step` and no `--initial`, error (current behavior)

The default step should probably require `value_schema` to either be absent or accept an empty object.

## Agent Health Checks

**Status: Planned** - see `pending-refactors/HEALTH_CHECK_PLAN.md`.

Replacing file-based heartbeats with task-based keepalives (ping-pong). Benefits:
- Initial keepalive gets tool-use approvals out of the way
- Periodic keepalives to idle agents detect disconnected agents
- No special agent code needed beyond following task instructions
- Agents can recover from timeout by simply calling `get_task` again

## Typestate Pattern for State Transitions

We introduced a pattern in `InFlight::complete(self, output)` where the state transition method lives on the inner type and consumes `self`. This couples the state transition with the action it enables (sending the response), making it harder to forget one or the other.

Look for other places where state and actions are decoupled and could benefit from this pattern:

- `AgentState` transitions (idle → busy, busy → idle)
- `Task` lifecycle (pending → dispatched → completed)
- `DaemonHandle` state (running → paused → shutdown)

The pattern: instead of separately mutating state and performing I/O, have a method on the state type that consumes it and returns the next state while performing the associated action.

```rust
// Before: decoupled state and action
agent.status = AgentStatus::Idle;
send_response(respond_to, &response)?;

// After: coupled via typestate
let idle = busy_agent.complete(output)?;  // consumes BusyAgent, returns IdleAgent, sends response
```

This is a low-priority refactor - apply opportunistically when touching related code.

## Full Socket-Based Protocol

Remove filesystem-based IPC entirely:

- Pool ID becomes just a PID or similar in-memory identifier
- All communication via socket (daemon ↔ agents, daemon ↔ submitters)
- `get_task` blocks on socket until task assigned
- `complete_task` sends response over socket
- No temp files, no directory watching
- Simpler, faster, easier to reason about

The CLI commands (`register`, `get_task`, `complete_task`) already abstract away the filesystem, so this would be a transparent change for agents using the CLI.
