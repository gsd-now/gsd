# Refactor Process

Big refactors follow a two-phase process:

## Phase 1: Architecture document

Create a markdown file in `refactors/pending/` describing:
- Motivation and goals
- Current state (with line numbers and code snippets)
- Proposed changes at the architectural level
- Open questions and design decisions

This document captures the *shape* of the refactor without getting into implementation details.

## STOP: Wait for approval

**After writing the architecture document, STOP and wait for explicit user approval before implementing ANYTHING.** Do not:
- Start implementing tasks
- Make "small independent changes"
- Commit code changes
- Push anything

The document exists for the user to review. They may have feedback, want changes to the approach, or decide not to proceed at all. **Only begin implementation after the user explicitly says to proceed.**

## Phase 2: Practical task list

Convert the architecture document into concrete, **independently deployable tasks**. Each task should be:

1. **Self-contained** - Can be implemented and deployed without other tasks
2. **Detailed** - Broken into numbered subtasks with specific file locations
3. **Actionable** - Include code snippets showing exactly what changes

**Expected level of detail for tasks:**

```markdown
## Task 1: Add Socket Transport Variant

**Goal:** One sentence describing the outcome.

**Current state:** What exists now and why it's insufficient.

### 1.1: Subtask Name

**File:** `path/to/file.rs`

Description of what to change:

\`\`\`rust
// Before
pub enum Transport {
    Directory(PathBuf),
}

// After
pub enum Transport {
    Directory(PathBuf),
    Socket(Stream),  // NEW
}
\`\`\`

**Complication:** Any gotchas or decisions to make.

### 1.2: Next Subtask
...
```

Each subtask should be small enough that someone could implement it without asking questions. Include:
- Exact file paths
- Before/after code snippets
- Complications or edge cases
- How to test the change

For examples, see `TRANSPORT_ABSTRACTION.md` and `DAEMON_REFACTOR.md` in `refactors/past/`.

## Extract independent work (after approval)

**Critical**: After receiving approval, actively identify changes that are independent of the main refactor. These should be:

1. **Extracted** into their own small changes
2. **Implemented first** before the main refactor
3. **Marked as done** in the plan

Examples of independent work:
- Format changes that don't affect behavior
- Removing dead code
- Adding new enum variants (before using them)
- Refactoring internal structure (typestate patterns, etc.)

The goal: by the time you start the "real" refactor, as much preliminary work as possible is already done. The remaining changes are the irreducible core that must happen together.

## Why this matters

- Smaller PRs are easier to review
- Independent changes can be tested in isolation
- If the main refactor is abandoned, the preliminary work still has value
- Reduces risk by making each change smaller

## Completing refactors

When a refactor is complete, move it from `refactors/pending/` to `refactors/past/`. This keeps the pending folder focused on active work and preserves completed designs for reference.
