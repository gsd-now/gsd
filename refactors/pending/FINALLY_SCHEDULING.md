# Finally Scheduling Refactor

**Status:** Not started

**Prerequisites:** VALUE_AND_RETRY_MODEL (COMPLETED), FINALLY_TRACKING (COMPLETED)

**Blocks:** STATE_PERSISTENCE (partially - persistence can work without this, but finally won't be logged)

---

## Bug: Synchronous Finally Blocks Concurrency

### The Problem

Currently, `handle_completion()` calls `run_finally_hook_direct()` **synchronously**. This blocks the entire runner loop, preventing other tasks from being dispatched even when concurrency slots are available.

### Reproduction Scenario

**Setup:**
- `max_concurrency = 1`
- Task A has a finally hook
- Task B has no finally hook
- Initial tasks: `[A, B]`

**Current (buggy) temporal trace:**

```
Time   Event                              in_flight  pending   Notes
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
t0     runner.next() called               0          [A, B]
t1     dispatch_all_pending()             0          [A, B]
t2       dispatch(A)                      1          [B]       A starts
t3     rx.recv() blocks...                1          [B]       waiting for A
t4     A completes, recv() returns        1          [B]
t5     process_result(A)                  1          [B]
t6       task_succeeded(A)                1          [B]
t7         handle_completion(A, Some)     1          [B]
t8           run_finally_hook_direct()    1          [B]       ← BLOCKS HERE
             ...finally runs...           1          [B]       B still waiting!
t9           finally returns              1          [B]
t10        spawned.is_empty() → remove A  0          [B]       slot freed
t11    return from process_result         0          [B]
t12    runner.next() called again         0          [B]
t13    dispatch_all_pending()             0          [B]
t14      dispatch(B)                      1          []        B finally starts
t15    rx.recv() blocks...                1          []
t16    B completes                        0          []
t17    done                               0          []

Observed order: A_done, A_finally, B_done
```

**Key problem:** Between t8 and t9, the runner is blocked running the finally hook. B cannot start even though A's action is complete and the concurrency slot should be free.

### Expected (fixed) temporal trace:

```
Time   Event                              in_flight  pending   Notes
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
t0     runner.next() called               0          [A, B]
t1     dispatch_all_pending()             0          [A, B]
t2       dispatch(A)                      1          [B]       A starts
t3     rx.recv() blocks...                1          [B]
t4     A completes, recv() returns        1          [B]
t5     process_result(A)                  1          [B]
t6       task_succeeded(A)                1          [B]
t7         handle_completion(A, Some)     1          [B]
t8           queue finally task F         1          [B, F]    F queued, not run
t9           A → Waiting{count:1}         0          [B, F]    slot freed!
t10    return from process_result         0          [B, F]
t11    runner.next() called again         0          [B, F]
t12    dispatch_all_pending()             0          [B, F]
t13      dispatch(B)                      1          [F]       B starts immediately
t14    rx.recv() blocks...                1          [F]
t15    B completes                        0          [F]
t16    dispatch_all_pending()             0          [F]
t17      dispatch(F)                      1          []        finally starts
t18    rx.recv() blocks...                1          []
t19    F completes                        1          []
t20      decrement_parent(A)              0          []        A done
t21    done                               0          []

Observed order: A_done, B_done, A_finally
```

**Key difference:** At t9, instead of blocking, we queue F and free the concurrency slot. B can start at t13 while A waits for F.

## Test Cases

### Test 1: `finally_should_not_block_concurrency`

**File:** `crates/gsd_config/tests/finally_retry_bugs.rs`

```rust
/// Bug: Synchronous finally blocks other tasks from starting.
///
/// Setup: max_concurrency=1, tasks [A, B] where A has finally
/// Expected order: A_done, B_done, A_finally (B starts while A waits for finally)
/// Actual (buggy): A_done, A_finally, B_done (finally blocks B)
#[test]
#[should_panic(expected = "wrong order")]
fn finally_should_not_block_concurrency() {
    // Config:
    // - max_concurrency: 1
    // - StepA: action completes, has finally hook that records "A_finally"
    // - StepB: action completes, records "B_done", no finally
    //
    // Initial tasks: [A, B]
    //
    // We use the mock pool's ability to control completion order.
    // Both A and B complete their actions quickly.
    // The finally hook also completes quickly.
    // The question is: does B start before or after A's finally runs?
}
```

### Test 2: `finally_retries_on_failure`

```rust
/// Finally tasks should retry on failure.
///
/// Setup: A has finally that fails twice, succeeds on third try
/// Expected: A completes successfully after finally succeeds
/// Current (buggy): Finally failures are silently ignored, no retry
#[test]
#[should_panic(expected = "finally did not retry")]
fn finally_retries_on_failure() {
    // Config:
    // - StepA: has finally hook that fails first 2 times, succeeds 3rd time
    // - retries: 3 for finally
    //
    // Verify that finally is retried and eventually succeeds
}
```

### Test 3: `finally_failure_propagates_after_retries_exhausted`

```rust
/// When finally exhausts retries, failure should propagate to parent.
///
/// Setup: A has finally that always fails, retries = 2
/// Expected: A's parent is notified of failure (or A is marked failed)
/// Current (buggy): Finally failures silently ignored
#[test]
#[should_panic(expected = "finally failure not propagated")]
fn finally_failure_propagates_after_retries_exhausted() {
    // Config:
    // - StepA: has finally hook that always fails
    // - retries: 2
    //
    // Verify that after 3 attempts (initial + 2 retries), failure propagates
}
```

---

## Implementation Details

### Data Structure Changes

#### `types.rs` - TaskKind enum (no magic strings)

Per coding standards, use enums instead of magic sentinel values like `"__finally__"`.

```rust
/// What kind of task this is - determines dispatch behavior.
pub enum TaskKind {
    /// Regular step task from config
    Step(Task),
    /// Finally task - runs when parent's children complete
    Finally {
        /// The step whose finally hook this runs (used to look up the script)
        step: StepName,
        /// Input value passed to the finally hook
        input: serde_json::Value,
    },
}

impl TaskKind {
    /// For logging - describe what this task is
    pub fn description(&self) -> String {
        match self {
            TaskKind::Step(task) => format!("step {}", task.step),
            TaskKind::Finally { step, .. } => format!("finally for {}", step),
        }
    }
}
```

**Note:** `StepName` will eventually be interned as a `u32`, making this very efficient. The actual `HookScript` is looked up from `config.steps[step].finally_hook` at dispatch time.

#### `types.rs` - TaskEntry changes

```rust
pub(super) struct TaskEntry {
    pub parent_id: Option<LogTaskId>,
    pub state: TaskState,
    pub kind: TaskKind,           // NEW: replaces Task in Pending state
    pub retries_remaining: u32,   // NEW: for retry logic (finally tasks retry too)
}

// TaskState::Pending no longer holds Task - it's in TaskEntry.kind
pub(super) enum TaskState {
    Pending,                      // CHANGED: no longer Pending(Task)
    InFlight(InFlight),
    Waiting {
        pending_count: NonZeroU16,
        continuation: Option<Continuation>,
    },
}
```

**Note:** `finally_for` field is NOT needed. The `parent_id` already tells us which task the finally is for. We can identify finally tasks by matching on `TaskKind::Finally`.

### Code Changes

#### `mod.rs` - `handle_completion()` changes

```rust
// BEFORE (synchronous):
fn handle_completion(&mut self, task_id: LogTaskId, continuation: Option<Continuation>) {
    let spawned = if let Some(cont) = continuation {
        let hook = self.config.steps.iter()
            .find(|s| s.name == cont.step_name)
            .and_then(|s| s.finally_hook.as_ref())
            .expect("continuation implies finally hook exists");
        run_finally_hook_direct(hook, &cont.value.0)  // ← BLOCKS
    } else {
        vec![]
    };
    // ... queue spawned tasks
}

// AFTER (async):
fn handle_completion(&mut self, task_id: LogTaskId, continuation: Option<Continuation>) {
    if let Some(cont) = continuation {
        // Queue finally as a task instead of running synchronously
        // Just pass the step name - script is looked up at dispatch time

        // Transition parent to Waiting for the finally task
        let entry = self.tasks.get_mut(&task_id).expect("task must exist");
        if matches!(entry.state, TaskState::InFlight(_)) {
            self.in_flight -= 1;
        }
        entry.state = TaskState::Waiting {
            pending_count: NonZeroU16::new(1).unwrap(),
            continuation: None,
        };

        // Queue finally task as child of this task
        self.queue_finally_task(cont.step_name, cont.value.0, task_id);
        return;
    }

    // No continuation - remove and notify parent (unchanged)
    // ...
}

fn queue_finally_task(
    &mut self,
    step: StepName,  // Which step's finally hook to run
    input: serde_json::Value,
    parent_id: LogTaskId,
) {
    let id = self.next_task_id();
    let kind = TaskKind::Finally { step: step.clone(), input };

    // Get retry count from step config
    let retries_remaining = self.step_map.get(&step)
        .map(|s| s.options.max_retries)
        .unwrap_or(0);

    let entry = TaskEntry {
        parent_id: Some(parent_id),
        state: TaskState::Pending,  // Always queue as Pending
        kind,
        retries_remaining,
    };

    // Just insert as Pending - dispatch_all_pending() handles concurrency
    let prev = self.tasks.insert(id, entry);
    assert!(prev.is_none());
    // Note: dispatch_all_pending() called at start of next iterator loop
}
```

#### `mod.rs` - `dispatch()` changes

Dispatch matches on `TaskKind`. The key invariant: `InFlight::new()` is only called immediately after spawning the thread - creating the marker proves dispatch happened.

```rust
/// Dispatch a pending task. Called from dispatch_all_pending().
/// Precondition: task_id exists in self.tasks with state Pending.
fn dispatch(&mut self, task_id: LogTaskId) {
    let entry = self.tasks.get_mut(&task_id).expect("task must exist");
    let TaskState::Pending = &entry.state else {
        panic!("dispatch called on non-Pending task");
    };

    let tx = self.tx.clone();

    match &entry.kind {
        TaskKind::Step(task) => {
            // Existing dispatch logic for regular tasks
            let step = self.step_map.get(&task.step).expect("step must exist");
            // ... spawn thread, submit to pool or run command
        }
        TaskKind::Finally { step, input } => {
            // Finally task - look up script from config, run as shell command
            let script = self.config.steps.iter()
                .find(|s| &s.name == step)
                .and_then(|s| s.finally_hook.as_ref())
                .expect("finally task must have corresponding hook in config")
                .clone();

            let input_json = serde_json::to_string(input).expect("input serializes");
            let working_dir = self.pool.working_dir.clone();

            info!(task_id = ?task_id, step = %step, "dispatching finally task");

            thread::spawn(move || {
                let result = run_shell_command(script.as_str(), &input_json, None);
                // ... send result back via tx
            });
        }
    }

    // InFlight::new() immediately after spawn - creating marker proves dispatch
    entry.state = TaskState::InFlight(InFlight::new());
    self.in_flight += 1;
}

/// Dispatch pending tasks up to max concurrency. Single place for concurrency check.
fn dispatch_all_pending(&mut self) {
    while self.in_flight < self.max_concurrency {
        let Some(task_id) = self.tasks.iter()
            .find_map(|(id, e)| matches!(e.state, TaskState::Pending).then_some(*id))
        else { break };

        self.dispatch(task_id);
    }
}
```

#### Finally task retry behavior

Finally tasks retry like any other task. On failure:

```rust
fn handle_finally_failure(&mut self, task_id: LogTaskId) {
    let entry = self.tasks.get_mut(&task_id).expect("task must exist");

    if entry.retries_remaining > 0 {
        entry.retries_remaining -= 1;
        entry.state = TaskState::Pending;  // Re-queue for dispatch
        self.in_flight -= 1;
        // Task stays in map, will be dispatched on next dispatch_all_pending()
    } else {
        // Retries exhausted - finally failed permanently
        // This is a failure that propagates to parent
        self.task_failed(task_id, None);
    }
}
```

#### Result types - Finally uses existing patterns

Finally tasks can use the existing `SubmitResult::Command` variant since they're shell commands. Alternatively, add a `Finally` variant if we want different processing:

```rust
pub(super) enum SubmitResult {
    Pool { ... },
    Command { ... },
    PreHookError(String),
    Finally {  // If we want distinct handling
        output: io::Result<String>,
    },
}
```

The key difference from `Command`: finally results are parsed as `Vec<Task>` (spawned tasks), not as step output.

## Task Tree Structure

### Before (current)

When A has finally that spawns C:
```
A completes
  → run_finally_hook_direct() SYNC
  → returns [C]
  → C queued as child of A

Tree:
A (Waiting for C)
└── C
```

### After (fixed)

When A has finally that spawns C:
```
A completes
  → queue finally task F as child of A
  → A waits for F

F dispatched
  → runs finally script
  → returns [C]
  → C queued as child of F
  → F waits for C

C completes
  → F.pending_count → 0 → F done
  → A.pending_count → 0 → A done

Tree:
A (Waiting for F)
└── F (finally task, Waiting for C)
    └── C
```

This is cleaner - finally is just another task in the tree.

---

## State Persistence Integration

### TaskSubmitted for finally tasks

```json
{"kind":"TaskSubmitted","task_id":4,"step":"__finally__","value":{"script":"./cleanup.sh","input":{...}},"parent_id":1,"finally_for":1}
```

### Resume logic

On resume, detect tasks needing finally:
1. Find all TaskCompleted entries
2. For each, check if step has finally hook (from config)
3. Check if finally task exists (TaskSubmitted with `finally_for: Some(task_id)`)
4. If not, and all descendants done, queue finally task

```rust
fn detect_missing_finally_tasks(
    config: &Config,
    completed: &HashSet<LogTaskId>,
    finally_submitted: &HashMap<LogTaskId, LogTaskId>,  // finally_for → task_id
) -> Vec<(LogTaskId, HookScript)> {
    let mut missing = vec![];

    for task_id in completed {
        // Check if this task's step has a finally hook
        let step = get_step_for_task(task_id);  // need to track this
        if let Some(hook) = &step.finally_hook {
            // Check if finally was already submitted
            if !finally_submitted.contains_key(task_id) {
                missing.push((*task_id, hook.clone()));
            }
        }
    }

    // Sort by depth (deepest first) to run in correct order
    missing.sort_by_key(|(id, _)| depth_of(*id));
    missing
}
```

---

## Edge Cases

### 1. Finally task times out

Currently not possible (shell commands don't have timeouts). After this change, finally tasks could have timeouts if we add that feature. For now, finally tasks run without timeout.

### 2. Finally task fails

**Current behavior:** failure is silently ignored, parent still completes.
**New behavior:** finally retries (default 3 attempts). If all retries exhausted, failure propagates - parent is notified that finally failed.

### 3. Crash during finally task

**Before:** finally runs synchronously, crash = no record, finally might re-run on resume.
**After:** finally is a task, TaskSubmitted logged. On resume, we see finally was submitted but not completed, so we re-run it (respecting remaining retries).

### 4. Finally spawns tasks that fail

Tasks spawned by finally are children of the finally task. If they fail, finally's pending_count decrements. When finally completes (success or failure after retries), parent is notified.

### 5. Retry of finally task

Finally retry works like any task retry:
- Retry gets same `parent_id` as failed finally
- Failed finally removed from map
- Retry takes its place
- Parent's pending_count unchanged (still waiting for 1 task)
