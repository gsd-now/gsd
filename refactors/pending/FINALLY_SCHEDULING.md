# Finally Scheduling Refactor

**Status:** Not started

**Prerequisites:** VALUE_AND_RETRY_MODEL (COMPLETED), FINALLY_TRACKING (COMPLETED)

**Blocks:** STATE_PERSISTENCE (partially - persistence can work without this, but finally won't be logged)

---

## Bug: Synchronous Finally Blocks Concurrency

### The Problem

Currently, `handle_completion()` calls `run_finally_hook_direct()` **synchronously**. This blocks the entire runner loop, preventing other tasks from being dispatched even when concurrency slots are available.

### Reproduction Scenario

**Setup:**
- `max_concurrency = 1`
- Task A has a finally hook
- Task B has no finally hook
- Initial tasks: `[A, B]`

**Current (buggy) temporal trace:**

```
Time   Event                              in_flight  pending   Notes
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
t0     runner.next() called               0          [A, B]
t1     dispatch_all_pending()             0          [A, B]
t2       dispatch(A)                      1          [B]       A starts
t3     rx.recv() blocks...                1          [B]       waiting for A
t4     A completes, recv() returns        1          [B]
t5     process_result(A)                  1          [B]
t6       task_succeeded(A)                1          [B]
t7         handle_completion(A, Some)     1          [B]
t8           run_finally_hook_direct()    1          [B]       ← BLOCKS HERE
             ...finally runs...           1          [B]       B still waiting!
t9           finally returns              1          [B]
t10        spawned.is_empty() → remove A  0          [B]       slot freed
t11    return from process_result         0          [B]
t12    runner.next() called again         0          [B]
t13    dispatch_all_pending()             0          [B]
t14      dispatch(B)                      1          []        B finally starts
t15    rx.recv() blocks...                1          []
t16    B completes                        0          []
t17    done                               0          []

Observed order: A_done, A_finally, B_done
```

**Key problem:** Between t8 and t9, the runner is blocked running the finally hook. B cannot start even though A's action is complete and the concurrency slot should be free.

### Expected (fixed) temporal trace:

```
Time   Event                              in_flight  pending   Notes
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
t0     runner.next() called               0          [A, B]
t1     dispatch_all_pending()             0          [A, B]
t2       dispatch(A)                      1          [B]       A starts
t3     rx.recv() blocks...                1          [B]
t4     A completes, recv() returns        1          [B]
t5     process_result(A)                  1          [B]
t6       task_succeeded(A)                1          [B]
t7         A has no children, has finally 0          [B]       in_flight decremented
t8         schedule_finally    0          [B, F]    F queued as root (A has no parent)
t9         remove A                       0          [B, F]    A gone, slot freed!
t10    return from process_result         0          [B, F]
t11    runner.next() called again         0          [B, F]
t12    dispatch_all_pending()             0          [B, F]
t13      dispatch(B)                      1          [F]       B starts immediately
t14    rx.recv() blocks...                1          [F]
t15    B completes                        0          [F]
t16    dispatch_all_pending()             0          [F]
t17      dispatch(F)                      1          []        finally starts
t18    rx.recv() blocks...                1          []
t19    F completes                        0          []        F is root, no parent to notify
t20    done                               0          []

Observed order: A_done, B_done, A_finally
```

**Key difference:** At t9, A is removed immediately after scheduling F. B can start at t13 while F waits in pending queue.

## Test Cases

### Test 1: `finally_should_not_block_concurrency`

**File:** `crates/gsd_config/tests/finally_retry_bugs.rs`

```rust
/// Bug: Synchronous finally blocks other tasks from starting.
///
/// Setup: max_concurrency=1, tasks [A, B] where A has finally
/// Expected order: A_done, B_done, A_finally (B starts while A waits for finally)
/// Actual (buggy): A_done, A_finally, B_done (finally blocks B)
#[test]
#[should_panic(expected = "wrong order")]
fn finally_should_not_block_concurrency() {
    // Config:
    // - max_concurrency: 1
    // - StepA: action completes, has finally hook that records "A_finally"
    // - StepB: action completes, records "B_done", no finally
    //
    // Initial tasks: [A, B]
    //
    // We use the mock pool's ability to control completion order.
    // Both A and B complete their actions quickly.
    // The finally hook also completes quickly.
    // The question is: does B start before or after A's finally runs?
}
```

### Test 2: `finally_retries_on_failure`

```rust
/// Finally tasks should retry on failure.
///
/// Setup: A has finally that fails twice, succeeds on third try
/// Expected: A completes successfully after finally succeeds
/// Current (buggy): Finally failures are silently ignored, no retry
#[test]
#[should_panic(expected = "finally did not retry")]
fn finally_retries_on_failure() {
    // Config:
    // - StepA: has finally hook that fails first 2 times, succeeds 3rd time
    // - retries: 3 for finally
    //
    // Verify that finally is retried and eventually succeeds
}
```

### Test 3: `finally_failure_propagates_after_retries_exhausted`

```rust
/// When finally exhausts retries, failure should propagate to parent.
///
/// Setup: A has finally that always fails, retries = 2
/// Expected: A's parent is notified of failure (or A is marked failed)
/// Current (buggy): Finally failures silently ignored
#[test]
#[should_panic(expected = "finally failure not propagated")]
fn finally_failure_propagates_after_retries_exhausted() {
    // Config:
    // - StepA: has finally hook that always fails
    // - retries: 2
    //
    // Verify that after 3 attempts (initial + 2 retries), failure propagates
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Data Structure Changes

#### `types.rs` - TaskKind enum (no magic strings)

Per coding standards, use enums instead of magic sentinel values like `"__finally__"`.

**Key constraint:** `TaskKind` is ONLY matched in `dispatch()` to determine how to spawn the task. All other code (retry, failure, completion, parent notification) treats tasks uniformly regardless of kind. This keeps the abstraction clean - "finally is just a task."

```rust
/// What kind of task this is - determines dispatch behavior.
/// ONLY matched in dispatch(). All other task handling is kind-agnostic.
pub enum TaskKind {
    /// Regular step task from config
    Step(Task),
    /// Finally task - runs when parent's children complete
    Finally {
        /// The step whose finally hook this runs (used to look up the script)
        step: StepName,
    },
}

impl TaskKind {
    /// For logging - describe what this task is
    pub fn description(&self) -> String {
        match self {
            TaskKind::Step(task) => format!("step {}", task.step),
            TaskKind::Finally { step, .. } => format!("finally for {}", step),
        }
    }
}
```

**Note:** `StepName` will eventually be interned as a `u32`, making this very efficient. The actual `HookScript` is looked up from `config.steps[step].finally_hook` at dispatch time.

#### `types.rs` - TaskEntry changes

```rust
pub(super) struct TaskEntry {
    pub parent_id: Option<LogTaskId>,
    pub state: TaskState,
    pub kind: TaskKind,           // NEW: replaces Task in Pending state
    pub retries_remaining: u32,   // NEW: for retry logic (finally tasks retry too)
    /// For Step tasks: output value, stored until children complete (if has finally)
    /// For Finally tasks: input value, passed to script at dispatch time
    pub effective_value: Option<EffectiveValue>,
}

impl TaskEntry {
    /// Get the step name from the task kind.
    pub fn step_name(&self) -> &StepName {
        match &self.kind {
            TaskKind::Step(task) => &task.step,
            TaskKind::Finally { step, .. } => step,
        }
    }
}

// TaskState::Pending no longer holds Task - it's in TaskEntry.kind
// TaskState::Waiting no longer holds continuation - finally is scheduled as sibling
pub(super) enum TaskState {
    Pending,                      // CHANGED: no longer Pending(Task)
    InFlight(InFlight),
    Waiting {
        pending_count: NonZeroU16,  // Just the count
    },
}
```

**Key simplification:** `Waiting` just holds `pending_count`. No continuation, no effective_value storage.

**Note:** `finally_for` field is NOT needed. The `parent_id` already tells us which task the finally is for. We can identify finally tasks by matching on `TaskKind::Finally`.

### Code Changes

#### `mod.rs` - Completion flow changes

The key insight: when a task with finally completes, schedule its finally as a **sibling** (child of the same parent), not as making the completed task wait. The completed task is removed immediately.

**Example:** A spawns B (which has finally)
1. B completes with `effective_value`
2. Schedule F (B's finally) as child of A → A's count: 1 → 2
3. Remove B, decrement A → A's count: 2 → 1
4. F completes → decrement A → A's count: 1 → 0
5. A is done (or schedules its own finally if it has one)

Tree structure is simpler - B is removed immediately, F takes its place:
```
A (waiting for F)
└── F (finally for B)
```

Instead of the more complex:
```
A (waiting for B)
└── B (waiting for F)
    └── F
```

```rust
/// Called when a task completes successfully.
/// If task has finally, schedules it as sibling. Then unconditionally removes task.
fn task_succeeded(
    &mut self,
    task_id: LogTaskId,
    spawned: Vec<Task>,
    effective_value: EffectiveValue,
) {
    self.in_flight -= 1;  // Unconditional - task was InFlight

    let entry = self.tasks.get(&task_id).expect("task must exist");
    let step_name = entry.step_name().clone();

    // Check if this step has a finally hook
    let has_finally = self.config.steps.iter()
        .find(|s| s.name == step_name)
        .and_then(|s| s.finally_hook.as_ref())
        .is_some();

    if spawned.is_empty() {
        // No children - schedule finally (if any), then remove
        if has_finally {
            self.schedule_finally(task_id, step_name, effective_value);
        }
        self.remove_and_notify_parent(task_id);  // Unconditional
    } else {
        // Has children - wait for them, store finally info for later
        let entry = self.tasks.get_mut(&task_id).expect("task must exist");
        let count = NonZeroU16::new(spawned.len() as u16).unwrap();
        entry.state = TaskState::Waiting { pending_count: count };

        // Store effective_value only if we have finally (need it when children complete)
        if has_finally {
            entry.effective_value = Some(effective_value);
        }

        for child in spawned {
            self.queue_task(child, Some(task_id));
        }
    }
}

/// Schedule a finally task for the given task. Does NOT remove the original task.
fn schedule_finally(
    &mut self,
    task_id: LogTaskId,
    step: StepName,
    effective_value: EffectiveValue,
) {
    let entry = self.tasks.get(&task_id).expect("task must exist");
    let parent_id = entry.parent_id;

    // Increment parent's count (we're adding a sibling)
    if let Some(parent_id) = parent_id {
        self.increment_waiting_count(parent_id);
    }

    // Create finally task - effective_value stored on TaskEntry, not in TaskKind
    let kind = TaskKind::Finally { step };
    self.queue_task_kind_with_value(kind, parent_id, Some(effective_value));
}

/// Increment a Waiting task's pending_count.
fn increment_waiting_count(&mut self, task_id: LogTaskId) {
    let entry = self.tasks.get_mut(&task_id).expect("task must exist");
    let TaskState::Waiting { pending_count } = &mut entry.state else {
        panic!("task not in Waiting state");
    };
    *pending_count = NonZeroU16::new(pending_count.get() + 1).unwrap();
}

/// Queue a task by kind with optional effective_value.
fn queue_task_kind_with_value(
    &mut self,

        parent_id,
        state: TaskState::Pending,
        kind,
        retries_remaining,
        effective_value,
    };

    self.tasks.insert(id, entry);
}

/// Queue a regular step task (effective_value not known yet).
fn queue_task(&mut self, task: Task, parent_id: Option<LogTaskId>) {
    self.queue_task_kind_with_value(TaskKind::Step(task), parent_id, None);
}

/// Remove task from map and decrement parent's count.
fn remove_and_notify_parent(&mut self, task_id: LogTaskId) {
    let entry = self.tasks.remove(&task_id).expect("task must exist");
    if let Some(parent_id) = entry.parent_id {
        self.decrement_parent(parent_id);
    }
}

/// Decrement parent's pending_count. If hits zero, schedule finally (if any), then remove.

    let TaskState::Waiting { pending_count } = &mut entry.state else {
        panic!("parent not in Waiting state");
    };

    let new_count = pending_count.get() - 1;
    if new_count == 0 {
        // All children done - same pattern as task_succeeded:
        // schedule finally (if any), then unconditionally remove
        let step_name = entry.step_name().clone();
        let has_finally = self.config.steps.iter()
            .find(|s| s.name == step_name)
            .and_then(|s| s.finally_hook.as_ref())
            .is_some();

        if has_finally {
            let effective_value = entry.effective_value.take()
                .expect("effective_value must be set for task with finally");
            self.schedule_finally(parent_id, step_name, effective_value);
        }
        self.remove_and_notify_parent(parent_id);  // Unconditional
    } else {
        *pending_count = NonZeroU16::new(new_count).unwrap();
    }
}
```

**Key changes:**
1. Finally is scheduled as **sibling** (child of same parent), not child of completed task
2. Completed task is removed immediately after scheduling its finally
3. Parent's count goes up (for finally) then down (for completed task) - net effect: waiting for finally instead of original task
4. `effective_value` only stored on TaskEntry if task has children AND has finally
5. `in_flight` decrement is unconditional in `task_succeeded`

#### `mod.rs` - `dispatch()` changes

**This is the ONLY place that matches on `TaskKind`.** The key invariant: `InFlight::new()` is only called immediately after spawning the thread - creating the marker proves dispatch happened.

```rust
/// Dispatch a pending task. Called from dispatch_all_pending().
/// Precondition: task_id exists in self.tasks with state Pending.
fn dispatch(&mut self, task_id: LogTaskId) {
    let entry = self.tasks.get_mut(&task_id).expect("task must exist");
    let TaskState::Pending = &entry.state else {
        panic!("dispatch called on non-Pending task");
    };

    let tx = self.tx.clone();

    match &entry.kind {
        TaskKind::Step(task) => {
            // Existing dispatch logic for regular tasks
            let step = self.step_map.get(&task.step).expect("step must exist");
            // ... spawn thread, submit to pool or run command
        }
        TaskKind::Finally { step } => {
            // Finally task - look up script from config, run as shell command
            let script = self.config.steps.iter()
                .find(|s| &s.name == step)
                .and_then(|s| s.finally_hook.as_ref())
                .expect("finally task must have corresponding hook in config")
                .clone();

            // effective_value stored on TaskEntry, not in TaskKind
            let effective_value = entry.effective_value.as_ref()
                .expect("finally task must have effective_value");
            let input_json = serde_json::to_string(&effective_value.0).expect("input serializes");

            info!(task_id = ?task_id, step = %step, "dispatching finally task");

            thread::spawn(move || {
                let result = run_shell_command(script.as_str(), &input_json, None);
                // ... send result back via tx
            });
        }
    }

    // InFlight::new() immediately after spawn - creating marker proves dispatch
    entry.state = TaskState::InFlight(InFlight::new());
    self.in_flight += 1;
}

/// Dispatch pending tasks up to max concurrency. Single place for concurrency check.
fn dispatch_all_pending(&mut self) {
    while self.in_flight < self.max_concurrency {
        let Some(task_id) = self.tasks.iter()
            .find_map(|(id, e)| matches!(e.state, TaskState::Pending).then_some(*id))
        else { break };

        self.dispatch(task_id);
    }
}
```

#### Finally uses existing task handling

**No special handling needed.** Outside of `dispatch()`, `TaskKind` is never matched. All task handling is kind-agnostic:
- Retry: uses existing `task_failed()` - no special case for finally
- Failure: uses existing failure propagation to parent - no special case for finally
- Result: uses `SubmitResult::Command` (it's a shell command) - same as any command task
- Spawned tasks: parsed from stdout as `Vec<Task>`, become children of finally task - standard behavior

The only finally-specific code is the match arm in `dispatch()` that looks up the script from config.

---

## Task Tree Structure

### Terminology

- **Vertical parent**: The task's `parent_id` - up the tree
- **Horizontal parent**: The task whose finally this is (semantic relationship)

A finally task's `parent_id` is the **vertical parent** (its horizontal parent's parent), NOT the horizontal parent itself.

### Before (current, buggy)

When A spawns B (which has finally):
```
A spawns B
B completes
  → run_finally_hook_direct() SYNC  ← BLOCKS
  → A notified

Tree during finally execution:
A (Waiting for B)
└── B (running finally synchronously, blocking everything)
```

### After (fixed)

When A spawns B (which has finally):
```
A spawns B
  → A is Waiting{1}

B completes
  → Schedule F (B's finally) as child of A  → A is Waiting{2}
  → Remove B, decrement A                   → A is Waiting{1}

F dispatched (asynchronously!)
  → runs finally script

F completes
  → decrement A                             → A is Waiting{0}
  → A removed (or schedules its own finally)

Tree after B completes:
A (Waiting for F)
└── F (finally for B, parent_id = A)
```

**Key insight:** F's `parent_id` is A (vertical parent), not B (horizontal parent). B is removed immediately. F is a sibling that takes B's place in A's child count.

### Finally that spawns tasks

When B's finally spawns cleanup task C:
```
A spawns B (B has finally that will spawn C)

B completes → F scheduled under A, B removed
A (Waiting{1})
└── F

F runs, spawns C
A (Waiting{1})
└── F (Waiting{1})
    └── C

C completes → F done → A done
```

Tasks spawned by finally (C) are children of the finally task (F), not siblings.

---

## State Persistence Integration

### TaskSubmitted for finally tasks

```json
{"kind":"TaskSubmitted","task_id":4,"step":"__finally__","value":{"script":"./cleanup.sh","input":{...}},"parent_id":1,"finally_for":1}
```

### Resume logic

On resume, detect tasks needing finally:
1. Find all TaskCompleted entries
2. For each, check if step has finally hook (from config)
3. Check if finally task exists (TaskSubmitted with `finally_for: Some(task_id)`)
4. If not, and all descendants done, queue finally task

```rust
fn detect_missing_finally_tasks(
    config: &Config,
    completed: &HashSet<LogTaskId>,
    finally_submitted: &HashMap<LogTaskId, LogTaskId>,  // finally_for → task_id
) -> Vec<(LogTaskId, HookScript)> {
    let mut missing = vec![];

    for task_id in completed {

## Edge Cases

### 1. Finally task times out

Currently not possible (shell commands don't have timeouts). After this change, finally tasks could have timeouts if we add that feature. For now, finally tasks run without timeout.

### 2. Finally task fails

**Current behavior:** failure is silently ignored, parent still completes.
**New behavior:** finally retries (default 3 attempts). If all retries exhausted, failure propagates - parent is notified that finally failed.

### 3. Crash during finally task

**Before:** finally runs synchronously, crash = no record, finally might re-run on resume.
**After:** finally is a task, TaskSubmitted logged. On resume, we see finally was submitted but not completed, so we re-run it (respecting remaining retries).

### 4. Finally spawns tasks that fail

Tasks spawned by finally are children of the finally task. If they fail, finally's pending_count decrements. When finally completes (success or failure after retries), parent is notified.

### 5. Retry of finally task

Finally retry works like any task retry:
- Retry gets same `parent_id` as failed finally
- Failed finally removed from map
- Retry takes its place
- Parent's pending_count unchanged (still waiting for 1 task)

## Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Add tests documenting bugs (one commit)

- [ ] `finally_should_not_block_concurrency` - scheduling bug
- [ ] `finally_retries_on_failure` - no retry bug
- [ ] `finally_failure_propagates_after_retries_exhausted` - silent failure bug
- [ ] All tests `#[should_panic]` with current implementation
- [ ] Commit with `--no-verify` (tests skip in sandbox)

### Phase 2: Data structure changes

- [ ] Add `TaskKind` enum with `Step(Task)` and `Finally { step }` variants (no input - stored on TaskEntry)
- [ ] Add `TaskEntry::step_name()` method to derive step from `TaskKind`
- [ ] Add `retries_remaining: u32` to `TaskEntry`
- [ ] Add `effective_value: Option<EffectiveValue>` to `TaskEntry` (only used when task has children AND finally)
- [ ] Change `TaskState::Pending` to not hold `Task` (task data now in `TaskEntry.kind`)
- [ ] Change `TaskState::Waiting` to only hold `pending_count` (remove `continuation`)
- [ ] Remove `Continuation` type entirely
- [ ] Update all `TaskEntry` construction sites

### Phase 3: Restructure completion flow

- [ ] `queue_task_kind`: common task insertion for both Step and Finally
- [ ] `queue_task`: wrap `queue_task_kind` with `TaskKind::Step`
- [ ] `increment_waiting_count`: bump a Waiting task's count
- [ ] `schedule_finally`: increment parent count, create `TaskKind::Finally`, call `queue_task_kind`
- [ ] `task_succeeded`: check for finally, schedule if present, then unconditionally remove
- [ ] `remove_and_notify_parent`: remove task and decrement parent
- [ ] `decrement_parent`: when count hits 0, check for finally, schedule if present, then remove
- [ ] Modify `dispatch()` to match on `TaskKind`
- [ ] Add dispatch logic for `TaskKind::Finally`

### Phase 4: Finally retry and failure handling

- [ ] Finally tasks use existing retry logic (via `retries_remaining`)
- [ ] Finally failure propagates to parent via existing `task_failed()`
- [ ] Spawned tasks from finally become children of finally task (standard behavior)

### Phase 5: Verify and clean up

- [ ] Remove `#[should_panic]` from all tests
- [ ] Verify all existing tests pass
- [ ] Update STATE_PERSISTENCE.md to note finally is now loggable
