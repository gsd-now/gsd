# State Persistence and Resume

**Status:** Not started

**Depends on:** ROOT_FLAG_REFACTOR (complete)

## Motivation

Long-running GSD jobs can be interrupted (crash, Ctrl+C, OOM). State persistence enables resuming from where you left off.

## Core Idea

The state file IS the internal task queue state. Completed tasks are append-only with unique IDs for debugging/tracking.

## State Structure

```rust
// crates/gsd_config/src/queue_state.rs

use crate::types::StepName;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

/// Unique identifier for a task instance.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct TaskId(u64);

/// The task queue state. This is both the runtime state AND the serialization format.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct QueueState {
    /// Counter for generating unique task IDs.
    next_id: u64,
    /// Tasks waiting to be processed.
    pub pending: Vec<PendingTask>,
    /// Task outcomes (append-only log).
    pub outcomes: Vec<TaskOutcome>,
}

/// A task waiting to be processed.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct PendingTask {
    pub id: TaskId,
    pub step: StepName,
    pub value: serde_json::Value,
    pub retries_remaining: u32,
}

/// The outcome of a task (append-only log entry).
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum TaskOutcome {
    /// Task completed successfully and returned next tasks.
    Completed {
        id: TaskId,
        step: StepName,
        value: serde_json::Value,
        retries_remaining: u32,
        /// IDs of tasks spawned by this task's completion.
        spawned: Vec<TaskId>,
    },
    /// Task failed.
    Failed {
        id: TaskId,
        step: StepName,
        value: serde_json::Value,
        retries_remaining: u32,
        reason: FailureReason,
    },
}

/// Why a task failed.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum FailureReason {
    /// Agent returned an error response.
    Error(String),
    /// Task timed out waiting for agent response.
    Timeout,
    /// Agent disconnected/crashed during task execution.
    AgentLost,
    /// Invalid response from agent (couldn't parse).
    InvalidResponse(String),
}

impl QueueState {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            next_id: 0,
            pending: Vec::new(),
            outcomes: Vec::new(),
        }
    }

    fn next_id(&mut self) -> TaskId {
        let id = TaskId(self.next_id);
        self.next_id += 1;
        id
    }

    /// Add a task to the pending queue.
    pub fn enqueue(&mut self, step: StepName, value: serde_json::Value, retries: u32) -> TaskId {
        let id = self.next_id();
        self.pending.push(PendingTask {
            id: id.clone(),
            step,
            value,
            retries_remaining: retries,
        });
        id
    }

    /// Remove a task from pending by ID.
    fn take(&mut self, id: &TaskId) -> Option<PendingTask> {
        let pos = self.pending.iter().position(|t| &t.id == id)?;
        Some(self.pending.remove(pos))
    }

    /// Mark a task as completed successfully.
    pub fn complete(&mut self, id: &TaskId, spawned: Vec<TaskId>) {
        if let Some(task) = self.take(id) {
            self.outcomes.push(TaskOutcome::Completed {
                id: task.id,
                step: task.step,
                value: task.value,
                retries_remaining: task.retries_remaining,
                spawned,
            });
        }
    }

    /// Mark a task as failed.
    pub fn fail(&mut self, id: &TaskId, reason: FailureReason) {
        if let Some(task) = self.take(id) {
            self.outcomes.push(TaskOutcome::Failed {
                id: task.id,
                step: task.step,
                value: task.value,
                retries_remaining: task.retries_remaining,
                reason,
            });
        }
    }
}
```

## State File Location

Default: `<root>/runs/<pool>.<run-id>.json`

Example: `/tmp/agent_pool/runs/mypool.a3f2c1.json`

The run ID is generated at start (short UUID). Multiple runs for the same pool tracked separately.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Internal State Representation

Change `TaskRunner` to use `QueueState` internally.

**Changes:**
- Add `QueueState`, `PendingTask`, `TaskOutcome`, `FailureReason`, `TaskId` types
- Modify `TaskRunner` to own a `QueueState`
- Replace `VecDeque<QueuedTask>` with iteration over `state.pending`
- When task completes: call `state.complete(id, spawned_ids)`
- When task fails: call `state.fail(id, error)`
- When new tasks spawn: call `state.enqueue(step, value, retries)` for each

**No CLI changes** - internal refactor only. Tests should pass unchanged.

### Phase 2: Deserialize Initial State into QueueState

Make `--initial-state` and `--entrypoint-value` flow through `QueueState`.

**Changes:**
- `RunnerConfig.initial_tasks: Vec<Task>` → `RunnerConfig.state: QueueState`
- `resolve_initial_tasks()` → `resolve_initial_state()` returning `QueueState`
- Parse inputs as `Vec<TaskInput>` where `TaskInput = {kind, value}`
- For each input, look up step config to get retries, call `state.enqueue(step, value, retries)`

**Flow:**
```
--initial-state '[...]' or --entrypoint-value '{...}'
        ↓
    Vec<TaskInput>  (just {kind, value})
        ↓
    for each: look up step config, call state.enqueue(step, value, retries)
        ↓
    TaskRunner::new(state)
```

### Phase 3: State Serialization/Deserialization

Add `--log` flag and ability to resume from log file.

**Changes:**
- Add `--log <path>` CLI flag (path to log file in `<root>/runs/`)
- On startup, print: `Creating log at <path>. Resume with: gsd run config.jsonc --log <path>`
- After each task completion, serialize `QueueState` to log file
- Delete log file on successful completion
- Modify `resolve_initial_state()` to detect and parse `QueueState` directly from log file

**Detecting log file vs task array:**
- If file contains `{"pending": [...], "outcomes": [...]}` → it's a `QueueState` (resume)
- If file contains `[{"kind": ..., "value": ...}]` → it's a `Vec<TaskInput>` (fresh start)

**Flow for resume:**
```
--log /tmp/agent_pool/runs/mypool.abc123.json
        ↓
    parse file → detect QueueState format
        ↓
    TaskRunner::new(state)
        ↓
    continue from where we left off
```

## CLI

```bash
# Normal run (no persistence)
gsd run config.jsonc --pool mypool --initial-state '[{"kind": "Start", "value": {}}]'

# Run with log file for resume capability
gsd run config.jsonc --pool mypool --initial-state '[...]' --log /tmp/agent_pool/runs/myrun.json
# Prints: Creating log at /tmp/agent_pool/runs/myrun.json. Resume with: gsd run config.jsonc --log /tmp/agent_pool/runs/myrun.json

# Resume from log file
gsd run config.jsonc --pool mypool --log /tmp/agent_pool/runs/myrun.json
```

## What We Don't Track (v1)

- **In-flight tasks**: On resume, tasks being processed are lost. May cause duplicate work.
- **Finally hook state**: On resume, finally hooks won't fire correctly if mid-fan-out.

## Future Work (TODOs)

Add to todos.md:

### List Resume Files

```bash
gsd runs list --root /tmp/agent_pool
# Shows: mypool.a3f2c1.json (3 pending, 5 completed, 2 failed)
```
